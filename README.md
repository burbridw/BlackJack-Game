Scrimba BlackJack challenge developed further

Hello
This is a development of a challenge that can be found in the Scrimba video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS4aFq5-91M - JavaScript Programming -Full Course

During that course, Per guides the viewer/learner through building a very simple version of the blackjack card game.

After finishing the course I wanted to go back to it and play around with adding new features and making it into a fuller game.

This is my first project of this type, but I have already found it immensly entertaining and fulfilling. 

You can of course find much better blackjack games out there! But the simple functionality of this pleases me.

Some functions include:
Tracking the player's cash total. You cannot play if you don't have enough to cover your bets.
An input field to allow the player to decide how much of their cash to bet on a single round.
The HOLD button, when the player no longer wishes to draw cards.
The dealer's turn - following most conventions of how blackjack dealers play their hands (always hit below 17, always hold above)
Tracking aces, and adjusting their value from 11 to 1 as necessary.

I would like at some point, to visually represent the cards on screen as they are being drawn, but that will be secondary to engaging with further learning resources.
