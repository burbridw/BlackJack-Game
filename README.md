Scrimba BlackJack challenge developed further

Hello
This is a development of a challenge that can be found in the Scrimba video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS4aFq5-91M - JavaScript Programming -Full Course

During that course, Per guides the viewer/learner through building a very simple version of the blackjack card game.

After finishing the course I wanted to go back to it and play around with adding new features and making it into a fuller game.

This is my first project of this type, but I have already found it immensly entertaining and fulfilling. 

You can of course find much better blackjack games out there! But the simple functionality of this pleases me.

Some functions include:
Tracking the player's cash total. You cannot play if you don't have enough to cover your bets.
An input field to allow the player to decide how much of their cash to bet on a single round.
The HOLD button, when the player no longer wishes to draw cards.
The dealer's turn - following most conventions of how blackjack dealers play their hands (always hit below 17, always hold above)
Tracking aces, and adjusting their value from 11 to 1 as necessary.

I would like at some point, to visually represent the cards on screen as they are being drawn, but that will be secondary to engaging with further learning resources.

EDIT: 27.8.2022: Updated to include vidual representations of the cards being dealt, as well as correcting ace functionality. If I continue to play with this project, I am considering adding a "bank" from which you can get loands which are repayed a little bit each turn. Along with that some function to determine the size of the loan and how repayments are managed. 
Some audio would also be nice, pleaseant background music with cues for draw, win, lose etc. Of course also with functions to mute music, sounds and all.
